  // Project 1
  "project1.title": "Capybara Combat Experience - CCE",
  "project1.description": "CCE is a Beat'em up game set in a university environment, inspired by the culture and symbolism of UFV and the Computer Science course. Developed as part of the INF 216 - Design And Implementation Of Digital Games course in the second semester of 2023, the game was created by me, Gabriel Campos Moreira Fernandes, and Cícero Cipriano Maciel. The game targets fans of the Beat'em up genre and classic 2D action games.",

  // Project 2
  "project2.title": "aVoid",
  "project2.description": "aVoid is a passion project I'm developing to learn and experiment with game programming and design. It's a simple yet challenging platformer with six levels (for now). Your goal? Reach the green portal to complete the level. But there's a catch—every time you finish a run, your past movements are recorded, creating a void that you must avoid in your next attempt. With each repetition, the challenge grows as you carefully plan new paths to victory. How many times can you avoid yourself?",
